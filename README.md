# HW 6: Critique a Visualization 

The assignment has two parts:

## 0. Choose a visualization to critique: 
1. [The census proves the US is diversifying. Here’s how – in five charts](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/aug/12/us-census-population-changes-white-americans)
2. [Is climate change making hurricanes worse?](https://www.theguardian.com/weather/ng-interactive/2018/sep/11/atlantic-hurricanes-are-storms-getting-worse)
3. [What #eclipse2017 looked like across the country](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/national/health-science/eclipse-2017-instagram/?utm_term=.bef4563ba560)
4. [These ARE the droids you are looking for](http://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/rngs/ENTERTAINMENT-STARWARS/010052224NF/index.html)
5. [Bombs in your backyard](https://projects.propublica.org/bombs/#b=27.161173134773225,-103.89021688971458,40.13214549963548,-72.18367392096458&c=shrink)
6. OR, another visualization of your choice (with prior approval!)

## 1. Present a short critique of the visualization: 
Consider the following questions to help guide your critique: 
- Does the visual representation support the goal of the visualization? 
- Are the choices of visual encoding appropriate? 
- - Is the interaction design intuitive?
- Does the visualization have strength or weakness w.r.t. accuracy, learnability, memorability, etc.? 
- How might someone mis-read, mis-interpret, or mis-use this visualization? 

A good critique will describe what a visualization does well and what it does poorly, with integration of relevant perceptual, cognitive, and social concepts to back up each claim. Be ready to discuss.

## 2. Redesign the visualization:
Consider the things that the visualization could have done better from Part 1. Redesign the visualization to address the shortcomings. You may sketch this with pen and paper or use a digital design tool of your choice. Be sure to describe (in text) what the interaction design would look like.

## Submission:
Your document should be in PDF format and with your submission for part 1 and part 2 on pages 1 and 2, respectively. Use Times Roman 11 point type with normal margins, 1.5 line spacing.
