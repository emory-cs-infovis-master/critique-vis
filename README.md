2. 

## 1. Present a short critique of the given visualization: 
Consider the following questions to help guide your critique: 
- Does the visual representation support the goal of the visualization? 
- Are the choices of visual encoding appropriate? 
- Does the visualization have strength or weakness w.r.t. accuracy, learnability, memorability, etc.? 
- How might someone mis-read, mis-interpret, or mis-use this visualization? 

A good critique will describe what a visualization does well and what it does poorly, with integration of relevant perceptual, cognitive, and social concepts to back up each claim. Be ready to discuss.

## 2. Redesign the visualization:
Consider the things that the visualization could have done better from Part 1. Redesign the visualization to address the shortcomings. You may sketch this with pen and paper or use a digital design tool of your choice. 

## Submission:
Your document should be in PDF format and with your submission for part 1 and part 2 on pages 1 and 2, respectively. Use Times Roman 11 point type with normal margins, 1.5 line spacing.
